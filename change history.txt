% This is a sample Matlab/Octave program which reconstructs an image sampled compressively 
% with binarized or continuous DCT functions using the FDRI method.

FDRI version history

1. v1.0, Aug 2018
 - initial release

2. v1.1, Feb 11, 2019
 - corrected svd-based calculation of pseudoinverse in the presence of very small eigenvalues (fdri.m)
 - rearanged folders 
 - changes in the example_fdri:  more test images are included, psnr is calculated, by default the bases functions are chosen deterministically (this improves PSNR by approx. 2 dB)

3. v1.2, Feb 14, 2019
  - added example 2 (example2_fdri_wh.m) with Walsh-Hadamard sampling and FDRI reconstruction
  - added example 3 (example3_fdri_morlet.m) with sampling based on binary or continuous Morlet wavelets convolved with white noise and with FDRI reconstruction
  - examples of sampling functions are also plotted (PlotSamplingFunctionExamples.m)
