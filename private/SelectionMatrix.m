function [SM]=SelectionMatrix(k,AvgDCT,random_basis_selection)
% Create a (logical) selection matrix SM for the DCT (or other) basis
% with k true elements at the selected DCT basis
% If random_basis_selection=true, selection is random with with the Bernoulli 
% probabilities proportional to AvgDCT 
% If random_basis_selection=false, selection is deterministic and is based on the largest
% average DCT components
