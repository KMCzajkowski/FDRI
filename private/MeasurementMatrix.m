function [M]=MeasurementMatrix(SM,binarize,invtransform)
% Return the measurement matrix M with rows containing DCT basis selected 
% by the elements of selection matrix SM
% invtransform may be used for other transforms than the DCT. 
% In this case, invtransform should be the inverse transform of the transform used
