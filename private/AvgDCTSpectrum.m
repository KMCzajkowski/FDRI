function [AvgDCT]=AvgDCTSpectrum(dim,img_path,fdtransform)
% Calculate the magnitude of the DCT spectrum averaged over an image database
% img_path is the path to images and images are called 'n.gif' with n=1..49
% Images are first resized to size dim
% fdtransform may be used for other transforms than the DCT. 
% In this case, fdtransform should be the transform to be used
